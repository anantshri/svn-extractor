Svn-Extractor
=============

Many a times web application pen-testers are encountered with the presence of .svn folders. For those not aware .svn folder is used by SVN version control system to perform its operations. For a blackbox pentest this folder contains huge amount of information.
Some of the key areas where this can help includes.

1) Uncover hidden files and folder names

2) Access the source code of the files.

3) download files even if the restrictions are in place at htaccess.

How this could be achieved.

1) Uncover hidden files and folder names

There are two ways in which this can be achieved based on the version of SVN in use.  
for <1.6 we had .svn/entries files which contained list of files / folders as well as usernames used for commiting those files.  
for >1.6 we have .svn/wc.db which contains simmilar data but in a sqlite3 format.  
These files could be directly accessible through url.

2) Access the source code / download files even if htaccess blocks its access.

SVN keeps a backup copy of all files in two seperate locations.

1) .svn/text-base/ **"filename"** .svn-base  
2) .svn/pristine/ **"XX"** / **"CHECKSUM"** .svn-base

where

**filename** is actual name of file.

**CHECKSUM** is Sha1 sum of the file

**XX** is first two character of **CHECKSUM**.

first type of entries has one limitations suppose file name is testme.php so path becomes.

*.svn/text-base/testme.php.svn-base*

a large number of servers will execute the file and serve the output.

that's where option 2 shines however this information is available only in case of wc.db (>1.6 SVN version) and this requires that .sv/pristine directory should be web accessible.

However after searching a lot i was not able to find a single code which can do both these things in one go.

so here is a tool which can perform both the operations in one script.

Usage
=====
**minimal**  

svn-extractor.py --url "url with .svn available"

**alloptions**  

python svnextractor.py --help  
usage: svnextractor.py [-h] --url TARGET [--debug] [--noextract] [--userlist] [--wcdb] [--entries] [--match MATCH] [--exclude EXCLUDES]

This program is used to extract the hidden SVN files from a webhost considering either .svn entries file (<1.6) or wc.db (> 1.7) are a actually automates the directory navigation and text extraction process  

optional arguments:  
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit  
  --url TARGET        Provide URL  
  --debug             Provide debug information  
  --noextract         Don't extract files just show content  
  --userlist          show the usernames used for commit  
  --wcdb              check only wcdb  
  --entries           check only .svn/entries file  
  --match MATCH       only download files that match regex
  --exclude EXCLUDES  exclude files with extensions separated by ','
